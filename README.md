# 🐶 Dog Vision Classifier

A simple deep learning project using PyTorch to classify images of dogs. Built and trained in Google Colab, this notebook walks through the process of:

- Loading and preprocessing image data
- Building a convolutional neural network (CNN)
- Training the model on a dog image dataset
- Evaluating the model performance
- Making predictions on new images

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Image classification with transfer learning
- ✅ PyTorch and Torchvision pipelines
- ✅ Training/validation accuracy tracking
- ✅ Easy to adapt for other image datasets
